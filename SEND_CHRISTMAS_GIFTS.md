# CHRISTMAS GIFTS
Imagine you have an account in Instagram. One day you have decided to send special Christmas gifts to your subscribers 
who was born in December in the USA and Great Britain.

So you have collected all subscriber's data in a json file and decided to select proper group and randomly 
split gifts of 3 different types (CANDLE, DWARF and CANDY) between them.
You have max 100 gifts of each type, so make sure that the whole amount will be separated into equal parts.

For example, if you will find 21  subscribers, gifts should be divided like 7-7-7. 
In case of 20 -  7-7-6,
in case of 2 -  1-1-0,
and so on.

At last, you have to print the result in a console using the template above:
"{Name} from {Country} will receive {Gift} !"

An example of a json file
```
[
{
"name": "Helen", 
"country": "USA", 
"birthday": "1994-08-01"
},
{
"name": "John",
"country": "GBR",
"birthday": "1998-02-22"
},
{
"name": "Tamia",
"country": "IND",
"birthday": "1956-12-09"
}
]
```
